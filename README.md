# IITM-Notes

Lecture notes and colab/jupyter notebooks

Colab/jupyter notebooks were written manually, so some of the code might be modified (Don't worry most of it will stay true to the original code shown the colab lectures).

If you find any errors or mistakes in the notebooks, please notify me through issues.

> NOTE: If you want to run MLT / MLP notebooks on GPU using cuML and cuPy then I would recommends installing rapids library through conda otherwise you can install the current dependencies using pixi / conda / pip.
